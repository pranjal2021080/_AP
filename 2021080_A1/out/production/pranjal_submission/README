Run the main in Main.java. Then my code would ask you the role for which you want to login. The login data of admin and professors have been provided in the code already and student need to register first for logging in.


--> FOR STUDENT FIRST REGISTER AND THEN LOGIN USING THE SAME DETAILS

--> PROFESSORS EMAIL AND PASSWORD ARE IN THE MAINE FILE ON LINE 23-25:-
    
   A. Name - name1
   Email - email1 Password - 123

   B. Name - name2
   Email - email2 Password - 123

   C. Name - name3
   Email - email3 Password - 123

  
ADMIN EMAIL - Admin@iiitd.ac.in
ADMIN PASSWORD - 123

I have added 6 courses in my code. Among these 3 are for the
first semester(MAT101,MAT102,MAT103) and 2 are for the second semester(CSE101,CSE102) and 1 for the 3rd semester (CSE103).

The professor initially does not know the courses allocated to him.

He will only know after the admin allocates the course to him .

The student need not register all the courses available in each semester, and if he fails in one of the course registered by him, then he will remain in the same semester.

Admin assigns grade and accordingly the SGPA is calculated eventually cgpa is also calculated.


OOPS CONCEPTS APPLIED:
1.CLASSES - Used everywhere to make different entities like student, professor , admin etc.
2.INTERFACE - "User" interface was used and implemented on student,professor and admin to make sure they implement a menu method.
3.POLYMORPHISM - Can be seen in various places like Overriding toString method to return string value of objects, Constructor overloading in classes by making parameterised and non parameterised constructors.
4.ENCAPSULATION - Getters are Setters are used in evey class to get and set private attributes (like name , email, password etc in student class).
